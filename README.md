Dealer
================

This Ruby on Rails application primarily serves two purposes:

- Is an online car dealership platform (that is deployed to Heroku and used in production for a friend's
car brokerage business)
- Is a platform for me to develop and demonstrate my Ruby on Rails coding skills

Problems? Issues?
-----------

If the application doesnâ€™t work as expected, please [report an issue](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues)
and include the diagnostics.

Dependencies
-------------

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.2.0
- Rails 4.2.0

This application is developed and tested with the following:

- PostgreSQL 9.4

This application has been designed to be deployed to Heroku (primarily through using the
[rails_12factor](https://github.com/heroku/rails_12factor) gem.  It should not be difficult to deploy this to other
environments, as no specific Heroku calls are made...although several Heroku add-ons (Rollbar, New Relic, etc) have
been utilized along with their corresponding gems.
