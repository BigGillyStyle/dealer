  # Final upload processing step:
  #
  # 1) If the file does not require processing, manually copy direct upload to
  #   the location that Paperclip expects, saving transfer time/cost.
  #   If the file requires post-processing, set the direct_upload_url as the image's remote source,
  #   which instantiates download, process, and re-upload of the file via Paperclip callbacks.
  # 2) Flag image as processed
  # 3) Delete the temp upload from s3.
